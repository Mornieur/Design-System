# FeitozaUI — Design System

**FeitozaUI** is a scalable, modern, corporate-style **Design System**, built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Atomic Design** principles.  
The system provides a unified set of **design tokens**, **reusable components**, **theme support**, and **complete documentation** through Storybook.

This project is evolving into a fully installable **UI library**, ideal for real-world apps and professional portfolio use.

## 🚀 Purpose

FeitozaUI was created to:

- Centralize design decisions (colors, typography, spacing, motion).
- Provide UI consistency across multiple applications.
- Speed up development through reusable, tested components.
- Serve as a visual and technical reference for developers.
- Ensure accessibility, theming support, and scalable architecture.
- Offer full Storybook documentation + code examples.
